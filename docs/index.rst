django-dajaxice
===============

Dajaxixe is an Easy to use AJAX library for django. Its main goal is to trivialize the asynchronous communication within the django server code and your js code. Dajaxice uses the unobtrusive standard-compliant (W3C) XMLHttpRequest 1.0 object.

django-dajaxice is a **JS-framework agnostic** library and focuses on decoupling the presentation logic from the server-side logic. dajaxice only requieres **5 minutes to start working.**

Dajaxice has the following aims:

* Isolate the communication between the client and the server.
* JS Framework agnostic (No Prototype, JQuery... needed ).
* Special support for frameworks (JQuery, currently) if requested).
* Presentation logic outside the views (No presentation code inside ajax functions).
* Lightweight.
* Crossbrowsing ready.
* `Unobtrusive standard-compliant (W3C) XMLHttpRequest 1.0 <http://code.google.com/p/xmlhttprequest/>`_ object usage.
